        Information that is being collected
        
        <br />
        We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
        
        <p />
        Puddies collects information to provide better services to all its users - from figuring out stuff like my parking space duration or location, to more complex things like reserving a parking space so you know where to park, when to leave, and showing you relevant ads while using Puddies. The information Puddies collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you choose to use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
        <p />
        
        Puddies uses your location and parking information to create a detailed parking history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. Puddies uses this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account and username (if you have chosen to sign up). This history is retained by Puddies for a limited period of time and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
        <p />
        
        Information you create or provide to us:
        <p />
        Account Information: information required when signing up, such as your name and gender. Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out-dated information may impair Puddies ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you when necessary.

        Information we collect as you use our services
        <p />
        We collect information about your activity in the Services, which we use to provide you with the Services of Puddies, including features which are meant to personalize your experience. This includes things like finding you the preferred parking space and propose favorites or destinations commonly parked by you to streamline your search. The activity information we collect may include:
        <p />
        Detailed location, parking and reserve parking information. Location and parking information is collected for example in the form of GPS signals (combined with a time-stamp) and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Application is installed and activated. This location and route information is saved to a history of all of the parking you have made while using the Application. The types of location data we collect depends in part on your device and account settings. For example, depending on your selected device settings and/or your account settings we may collect information about your location and parking (or lack thereof) also while you are not using the app, in order to be able to tell you when to leave for planned parking, provide you parking assistance, analyze how effective our ads are and more;
        <p />
        <p />
        Terms or venues you searched for parking;
        <p />
        Your views and interactions with content and ads;
        <p />
        Your voice and audio information when you use voice and audio features;
        <p />
        Communication or other content you chose to share with any third party, including Puddies users through the Services;
        <p />
        Your activity on third-party sites and apps that you chose to link to your Puddies account or that you interact with through the Service.
        <p />
        Meta-data (information about your device, browser and app use):
        <p />
        Once you install the Application, Puddies collects information about the use of the Services and information from the device you have Puddies installed on. For example:
        <p />
        Puddies may collect and record how often you use the app and for how long, your device type, unique identifiers, operating system type & version, battery usage, the third party web pages or applications you visit or use or interact with via the Application, information that you viewed on our Services, advertisements that are shown to you or that you view or click on, the fact that you used the Services to communicate with other users and the fact that you used third parties application/services via Puddies to communicate with third parties, and the duration of such communications, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the name of the domain that serves you to access the Services, and the geographic location of the device that you are using to log in and use Puddies on.
        <p />
        Puddies may also collect information about apps installed on your device that Puddies can link with - such as third party routing service apps (e.g. Google Maps).
        <p />
        We also collect information about the interaction of your devices with our Services, including, parking reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.
        <p />
        Information we collect about you from our partners
        <p />
We work with ad partners, including entities that belong to the Google group of companies, in order to show you more relevant and useful ads based on your Puddies activity and information associated with your device’s identifier (i.e, Advertising identifiers or similar technologies) shared with us by our ad partners. Your device’s identifier can be managed in your device’s settings (for more information: see here and here).
        <p />
You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-app Privacy Settings–>Ads personalization. Note: turning Ads personalization off does not turn off ads - only their personalization. For more information see section titled ‘Advertising campaigns’ under this Privacy Policy.
        <p />
We may also receive aggregated, non-personally identifiable information and analysis from third parties measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with our ads. We may also receive information from third party services about how Puddies’ own marketing efforts performed on third party sites or platforms.
        <p />
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including, cookies, local storage, browser web storage, application data caches, databases, and server logs
        <p />

Based on your past activity on the Services we may also suggest to you common destinations where you use the app to navigate to.

We may also use data to measure the usability and effectiveness of Puddies’ own marketing efforts on third party sites or platforms.

At any time you may choose not to receive such materials by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the email messages that we may send to you. In any case, Puddies will not share your contact details with any advertiser, unless explicitly permitted or required by law.

        <p />
To enforce the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy;
        <p />
To contact you when Puddies believes it to be necessary;

        <p />For purposes provided under this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use;
        <p />To help improve the safety and reliability of our Services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to security risks, and technical issues that could harm Puddies, our users, or the public;
        <p />To create aggregated and/or anonymous data (where such data does not enable the identification of a specific user). See “How does Puddies use aggregated information”, below;
        <p />We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

        <p />Sharing your information
        <p />Personal information that you share
        <p />The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Puddies and with other members of that community.

        <p />In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files. This information may be shared either directly to the Services and to all users, such as in the case of searching for a parking space, reserved one, or just to your friends on Puddies. This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Services upon such users’ choice.

        <p />You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you choose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor confidential and you should expect that it may be made public and known to others. Information you choose to upload will be posted along with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your publicly available user profile. You should note that the parking spaces you registered may include your personal information. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.

        <p />In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.

        <p />if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command features, Puddies will collect the voice information related to such use, including voice files. If, after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Puddies users and other people will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded, Puddies may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being made public.

        <p />We, at Puddies, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Services. However, Puddies has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.

        <p />Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Puddies, is entirely at your own risk. Puddies is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulations or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.

        <p />When Puddies shares your information
        <p />Puddies does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.

        <p />Puddies will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in Puddies’ good-faith discretion:

        <p />As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services. For example, showing the available parking space you registered and which are associated with your username and your location;

        <p />If Puddies reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or performed any act or omission that Puddies reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. Puddies may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;

        <p />If Puddies is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;

        <p />In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Puddies, or between you and other users with respect to, or in relation with the Services;

        <p />In any case where Puddies reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Puddies, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;

        <p />To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;

        <p />If Puddies organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Puddies is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if Puddies enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;

        <p />To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting services or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to Puddies, as reasonable for business purposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside of your jurisdiction;

        <p />Puddies may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with Puddies, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies;

        <p />We work with other Google’s services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Puddies, we may share information with these services. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in this page. For more information see section titled ‘Advertising campaigns’ under this Privacy Policy.

        <p />We also work with selected measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with our ads (such as DoubleClick Campaign Manager) and in order to measure Puddies’ own marketing efforts (such as AppsFlyer services), by using and sharing the device’s identifier (i.e, Advertising ID or similar technologies).

        <p />Personal information may also be shared with Puddies’ trusted partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer services.

        <p />Visibility

        <p />Please note that your username and some other information will be visible to others. Note that your username will be included along with any information you submit for parking (such as parking details or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others. Also - your friends on Puddies will see your name & profile photo and any other information you chose to share with them.

        <p />If you prefer to remain invisible on the Puddies map, you can set the Puddies Application not to show your location on the map. To do so you should go to the Privacy Settings and adjust accordingly by switching on to Invisible Mode. If on, some features may not be available. If you make this choice, while you will be ‘invisible’ on the map to other users, your location and parking information will continue to be collected by Puddies for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy may be visible to other Puddies’ users.

        <p />Integration with social networks
        <p />You may choose to share information between your Puddies account and your social network account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Puddies, including your location and parking information, transmitted to and shared through your social network account.

        <p />By setting your Puddies Account to integrate with social networks, including by signing onto Puddies by using your social network account (such as your Facebook account), you agree to share information (including personal information) between Puddies and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.

        <p />The social network’s use of information made available by Puddies is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Puddies.

        <p />When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked by the social network to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with Puddies. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the permissions granted by you (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture and other information available via the applicable social network).

        <p />You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store such information so that it is available on and through your Puddies Account, until your Puddies Account is deleted.

        <p />Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social network accounts may become public to other Puddies Users through the Services once you have allowed the social network to share such information with Puddies.

        <p />Integration with other third party services

        <p />Puddies may offer you the option to link Puddies to third party services that may be useful to you (like, Facebook). Where Puddies detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service attempts to link to Puddies, or Puddies detects an installed service on the device which has an integration option, or you request a particular integration), Puddies will ask for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts, Puddies will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the accounts and Puddies is not responsible for the third party service’s use of data. You can disconnect Puddies and the third party service at any time and Puddies will cease sharing data with that service from the point of disconnection onwards.

        <p />Controlling your personal information

        <p />You can always review and update certain information by visiting your Account & Login settings such as your profile, name etc.

        <p />You can review your parking history in Puddies.  Note that in order to access certain information you will need to sign up. Your location and parking history is associated with your Account and the unique identifier generated by Puddies.

        <p />Privacy controls

        <p />In-app Privacy Settings provide you with quick access to settings and tools that let you safeguard your data and decide how your information can make Puddies services work better for you. For example, you can control your visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Puddies.

        <p />There are other ways to control the information Puddies collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Puddies Account, including device-level settings: your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your device.

        <p />Deleting your information

        <p />If you would like us to delete your Account, please use the “Delete Account” function available under the in-app Privacy. On receiving such a request, Puddies will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note that information may not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems. We aim to initiate the deletion process immediately after your request. Once we receive your request, your data will no longer be used to personalize your Puddies experience. We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion. As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and time frames defined in this policy. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.

        <p />How Puddies retains data we collect

        <p />Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary. This section describes why we hold onto different types of data for different periods of time.

        <p />Information retained until you remove it - such as your name, social media profile, email address and other account related information. We’ll keep this data in your Puddies Account until you choose to remove it and/or update it.
        <p />Data that expires after a specific period of time - in some cases, you don’t need to actively delete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data’s collection. 

        <p />Information retained until your Puddies Account is deleted - we may keep some data for the life of your Puddies Account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. For example, if you made a reservation of parking, we will keep information you submitted, even after the event is removed. 

        <p />Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes - sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. 
        <p />Reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include:
        <p />Security, fraud & abuse prevention
        <p />Financial record-keeping
        <p />Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
        <p />Ensuring the continuity of our services
        <p />Direct communications with Puddies

        <p />How does Puddies use aggregated information?
        <p />Puddies may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes (including advertising).

        <p />Puddies may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party. For example, GPS information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, and aggregated ads analysis may be provided to advertisers.

        <p />Cookies
        <p />Puddies may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services. Cookies are packets of information sent by the Website’s servers to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the Website’s servers.

        <p />Puddies may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-enter your username and password each time you log in, to facilitate the use of the Website, to collect statistical information, to verify information, and to customize the Website to your personal preferences and for information security purposes.

        <p />Some of the cookies may expire when the session ends and you exit your browser. Other cookies are saved on your computer’s hard drive. If you wish to block the Website’s cookies, then please use the help button in your browser and follow the necessary instructions. However, bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent your use of the Website, or certain features thereof.

        <p />Advertising campaigns
        <p />Puddies allows advertisers to run ad campaigns on the Services.

        <p />The information and advertisements that you see when accessing the Services may be targeted on the basis of your current Puddies activity, such as your current location, your destination or contextual information based on your current parking session. For example: if you search for “gas station” you may see an ad for a local gas station.

        <p />Depending on your settings, you may also see ads personalized to you based on:

        <p />You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-app Privacy Settings–>Ads personalization. Note: turning Ads personalization off does not turn off ads - only their personalization.

        <p />Please note:

        <p />We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
        <p />We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.
        <p />As described under “When Puddies shares your information” section above, we work with other Google’s services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Puddies, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, Puddies may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in this page.

        <p />The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Puddies on the Puddies platform and they do not apply to ads served on third parties platforms, including on Puddies’ behalf.
        <p />When you visit a third party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on your device. The third party’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not to this Privacy Policy. If you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you should visit their services, or contact them directly.

        <p />The Services includes an internal messaging system which provides you the ability to send and receive messages to and from other users, and to receive marketing messages from us. You hereby agree that we may use the internal messaging system for the purpose of informing you regarding products or services, which may interest you.

        <p />Please note however that other Puddies users are not allowed to use your contact details or our internal messaging account for commercial advertising purposes. If you have encountered any user generated advertising material, please inform us through the “Contact Us” page in the app setting page.

        <p />It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by third parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof.

        <p />Information security

        <p />Puddies considers information security to be a top priority. Puddies services are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. Puddies implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Puddies employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

        <p />The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

        <p />However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, although Puddies takes great efforts to protect your personal information, Puddies cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Puddies’ databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.

We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

        <p />European requirements
