        Information that is being collected
        
        <br />
        We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
        
        <p />
        Puddies collects information to provide better services to all its users - from figuring out stuff like my parking space duration or location, to more complex things like reserving a parking space so you know where to park, when to leave, and showing you relevant ads while using Puddies. The information Puddies collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you choose to use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
        <p />
        
        Puddies uses your location and parking information to create a detailed parking history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. Puddies uses this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account and username (if you have chosen to sign up). This history is retained by Puddies for a limited period of time and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
        <p />
        
        Information you create or provide to us:
        <p />

        <p />
        We collect information about your activity in the Services, which we use to provide you with the Services of Puddies, including features which are meant to personalize your experience. This includes things like finding you the preferred parking space and propose favorites or destinations commonly parked by you to streamline your search. The activity information we collect may include:

        Detailed location, parking and reserve parking information. Location and parking information is collected for example in the form of GPS signals (combined with a time-stamp) and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Application is installed and activated. This location and route information is saved to a history of all of the parking you have made while using the Application. The types of location data we collect depends in part on your device and account settings. For example, depending on your selected device settings and/or your account settings we may collect information about your location and parking (or lack thereof) also while you are not using the app, in order to be able to tell you when to leave for planned parking, provide you parking assistance, analyze how effective our ads are and more;
        <p />
        <p />
        Terms or venues you searched for parking;
        <p />
        Your views and interactions with content and ads;
        <p />
        Your voice and audio information when you use voice and audio features;
        <p />
        Communication or other content you chose to share with any third party, including Puddies users through the Services;

        <p />
We may also receive aggregated, non-personally identifiable information and analysis from third parties measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with our ads. We may also receive information from third party services about how Puddies’ own marketing efforts performed on third party sites or platforms.
        <p />

        <p />We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

        <p />Sharing your information
        <p />Personal information that you share
        <p />The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Puddies and with other members of that community.

        <p />In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files. This information may be shared either directly to the Services and to all users, such as in the case of searching for a parking space, reserved one, or just to your friends on Puddies. This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Services upon such users’ choice.

        <p />You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you choose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor confidential and you should expect that it may be made public and known to others. Information you choose to upload will be posted along with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your publicly available user profile. You should note that the parking spaces you registered may include your personal information. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.

        <p />In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.

        <p />if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command features, Puddies will collect the voice information related to such use, including voice files. If, after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Puddies users and other people will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded, Puddies may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being made public.

        <p />We, at Puddies, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Services. However, Puddies has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.

        <p />Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Puddies, is entirely at your own risk. Puddies is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulations or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.

        <p />When Puddies shares your information
        <p />Puddies does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.

        <p />Puddies will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in Puddies’ good-faith discretion:

        <p />As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services. For example, showing the available parking space you registered and which are associated with your username and your location;

        <p />If Puddies reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or performed any act or omission that Puddies reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. Puddies may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;

        <p />If Puddies is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;
