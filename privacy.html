<p />
Puddies respects your privacy. Puddies and its affiliates (“Puddies” or the “Company”) offer users of Puddies’s mobile applications (the “Application”) (collectively referred to as the “Services”). When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

<p />
This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, and delete your information.

<p />
To use our Services you must be 16 years of age or older. If you are under 16, you may not download or use the Services.

<p />
In this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” means information which you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email, friends, public profile picture, and, in certain circumstances, your location and route information or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Puddies.

User Accounts and Accessing the Services
<br />
Please note that when you install the Application on your mobile device, Puddies will set up an account associated with that mobile device (the “Account” or “Puddies Account”). After installation, Puddies will collect and use your information, including meta-data (as described below), in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This use may include linking your information with your Account.

<p />
Puddies may allow you to use the Puddies Application whether or not you choose to sign up for Puddies for yourself. You might not allow to use some of the Puddies Services without signing up.

<p />
If you do sign up in the Application:

<p />
Puddies will link all of your information with your Account and that username. This includes information received from all mobile devices running the Application on which you have chosen to sign in using your username and password;

<p />
With the exception described in the bullet below and as explained in the section “Visibility” below, your Account and information associated with your Account will be visible only to Puddies; and

<p />
When using the Application, your approximate location and other information you may choose to contribute will be visible to other users associated with that username.
Puddies may also establish and require from time to time additional or different means of identification and authentication for logging in and accessing the Services or for accessing certain features or designated sections of the Services.

<p />
Your login details are your responsibility. You are fully accountable for any use or misuse of your Account and personal details as a result of conveying your login details to someone else. You must maintain your login details in absolute confidentiality and avoid disclosing them to others. Make sure that you change your password frequently and at least once every six months.

<p />
Information that is being collected

<br />
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

<p />
Puddies collects information to provide better services to all its users - from figuring out stuff like my parking space duration or location, to more complex things like reserving a parking space so you know where to park, when to leave, and showing you relevant ads while using Puddies. The information Puddies collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you choose to use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
