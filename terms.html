        <p style="font-size: 17px; ">TERMS OF SERVICE</p> 
        <p />These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your rights and obligations regarding the use of Puddies’ Software (“Software”) 
            and service (both collectively referred to as the “Service”) on the Internet or in cellular media. 
            These Terms constitute a fully binding agreement between Waze Mobile Ltd. (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, 
            “Puddies” or “We”) the proprietor of all rights in and to the Service, and you. 
            It is therefore recommended that you carefully read these Terms.

        <p />By using the Puddies Service, you signify your assent to these Terms;

        <p />Puddies' privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”); and Puddies' copyright policy (“Copyright Policy”), all of which are an integral part of these Terms.

        <p />If you do not agree to these Terms or any of its parts, then you are prohibited and must refrain from using the Service.
        
        <p />The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. 
            These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section 
            does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Puddies.
        
        <p />The parking space information provided by the Service is submitted by other users in Puddies.  
           There is no guarantee you can ultimately take the space you reserved;
        
        <p />Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. 
        It is strictly forbidden to search for any parking space, or to interact with the Service or use the Service for any purpose. 
        Alternatively, searching for parking space may be performed by a passenger other than the driver, 
        provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.

        <p />The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. 
        Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. 
        Puddies does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.
