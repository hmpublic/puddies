            (“Software”) and service (both collectively referred to as the “Service”) on the Internet or in cellular media. 
            These Terms constitute a fully binding agreement between Puddies. (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, 
            “Puddies” or “We”) the proprietor of all rights in and to the Service, and you.

        <p />Puddies' privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”); and Puddies' copyright policy (“Copyright Policy”), all of which are an integral part of these Terms.

        <p />If you do not agree to these Terms or any of its parts, then you are prohibited and must refrain from using the Service.
        
        <p />The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. 
            These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section 
            does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Puddies.
        
        <p />Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. 
        It is strictly forbidden to search for any parking space, or to interact with the Service or use the Service for any purpose. 
        Alternatively, searching for parking space may be performed by a passenger other than the driver, 
        provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.

        <p />The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. 
        Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. 
        Puddies does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.
        
        <p />Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, 
        for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device 
        on which the Puddies application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided 
        without utilizing this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the Privacy Policy:

        <p />i) Puddies uses your location and relevant information to create a detailed parking history 
        of all of your journeys made when using the Service. Puiddes uses this history to offer the Service to you, 
        to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of 
        its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy.

        <p />ii) Puddies allows you to use the Service whether or not you choose to login for yourself. 
        If you choose to use the Service without login you may do so by skipping the login of the application.

        in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Note that in order to access certain features of the Service 
        (for example searching or reserving a parking space, interacting with other puddies) you will need to login.
